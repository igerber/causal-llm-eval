"""Three-layer telemetry capture for agent runs.

Layer 1 - Stream-JSON event log from Claude Code:
    Parsed from `claude --print --output-format stream-json` output. Contains
    every user/assistant turn, every tool call (Bash, Read, Edit, Write, Grep)
    with arguments and results, and file reads with paths.

Layer 2 - In-process Python instrumentation (the discoverability ground truth):
    A `sitecustomize.py` installed in the per-run venv hooks the target library
    and writes per-event JSON records. Catches access that stream-JSON misses
    (e.g., `python -c "from diff_diff import get_llm_guide"` reads the file via
    Python, not Claude's Read tool). See `harness/sitecustomize_template.py`.

Layer 3 - Subprocess stderr capture:
    Captures Python warnings and any other stderr the agent's Python processes
    emit. Cross-checked with the in-process warning log.

Skeleton only.

    """Merged per-run record assembled from three layers.

    Discoverability fields use a three-state encoding:
        - ``True``  - the agent accessed this surface
        - ``False`` - the agent did NOT access this surface (and could have)
        - ``None``  - this surface is "not applicable" to the arm; absence is
          structural, not behavioral. Used for arm-2 (statsmodels) on the
          `opened_llms_*` and `called_get_llm_guide` fields, since statsmodels
          ships no LLM-targeted guides.

    Comparator-fairness analysis distinguishes "could-have-but-didn't" (False)
    from "couldn't-have-because-no-such-feature" (None). Collapsing these
    biases the comparison in favor of the arm with no guidance surface.

    The ``arm`` field is required so ``merge_layers()`` and downstream graders
    can validate that the sentinel pattern matches the arm's contract (e.g.,
    ``opened_llms_txt is None`` iff ``arm == "statsmodels"``).
